# Chatty

## Description
This is a Vanilla JS application that runs on a backend of express, node.js and socket.io. Currently, a user can type in their username and join one of the rooms. The next iteration takes the app from Vanilla JS implementation on the front end to one primarily composed of Lit-element and one where users can create new rooms and send the links for rooms to invite friends to join rooms.

**Due to time constraints, the app has been expanded on with react instead of lit-element and can be found in the react-version branch**

## Libraries and tools used
- Express
- Socket.io
- Vanilla JavaScript
- node.js

## Run app locally
1. Clone the repo
