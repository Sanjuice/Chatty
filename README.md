# Chatty

## Description
This is a Vanilla JS application that runs on a backend of express, node.js and socket.io. Currently, a user can type in their username and join one of the rooms. The next iteration takes the app from Vanilla JS implementation on the front end to one primarily composed of Lit-element and one where users can create new rooms and send the links for rooms to invite friends to join rooms.

**The lit-element version of the application is present on the lit-version branch**
